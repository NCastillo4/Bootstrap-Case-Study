          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>The Problem: Users currently aren’t connecting with  Habitat for Humanity’s website due to an inundation of information that is unclear and unorganized. Users that visit the website in search of volunteer opportunities in particular find that the navigation flow to get to the correct information is confusing.
          </p>
          <p>The Solution: Redesign and optimize the website to create an engaging and productive experience for the users, so that they are more inclined to volunteer and reach their goals as well as helping their community.  </p>

          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p>We took a hybrid approach to our initial user research interviews by conducting a combination of task testing of the existing website as well as asking users interview questions. This helped us gain a better understanding of each user’s familiarity with the website and organization prior to the user test. This approach also helped us to learn what each user liked and disliked regarding the existing website’s usability, flow and engagement

            There’s a lot of content available on the website, it just needs to be refined and better organized

              <p>Our Prioritization Matrix helped us narrow down main features we would incorporate into the redesign which we were able to include most of, such as; filtering/ selecting volunteer options based on availability, project description, clearer text, connection
              </p>
              <p>Ideas such as communicating with other users on the same platform would become a feature development item

              <p>During user testing many users found the navigation menu to be confusing due to the wording used as well as an overload of subcategories in the secondary navigation.
              </p>
              <p>Our goal was to simplify and make the main navigation more relatable, intuitive and also help form a connection with the organization by using headings such as “ Who We Are” What We Do”, etc.

                  Users found the “Our Goal”  and we “Need Your Support” sections on the homepage confusing. This helped us decide to eliminate “Our Goal” and display the mission at the forefront of the layout and reworded “ We Need Your Support” to “Other Ways To Give”.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Accessibility, Help & Contact Us items were too visually similar in the navigation menu. We thought it would then be best to change these to “icons with text” to differentiate them from the menu items
              </li>
              <li>
                We learned that planning was more important to users vs. demographics in the filters which led to our decision to move planning categories to the top of the filters
              </li>
              <li>
                Users liked the option of being able to apply or save on the “Project Page”, however, the “Save” button was a bit confusing as they were unclear what they were saving. We decided to incorporate a heart icon on the project page so the user could click the heart to save to their “Saved Projects”

                    Filter and organize information in other parts of the website that are essential. In particular, the Donation page as there are so many ways to donate that it may be helpful to simplify, condense and display that information in way that doesn’t feel overwhelming for users.

                  <li>
                    Create a messaging platform within the site. For instance, if a volunteer wants to direct message regarding a particular project or connecting with other volunteers.

                  <li>
                    Incorporate notes and calendar section within a users profile so they may keep their notes, project dates, etc within their profile.
