          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>The Problem: Users currently aren’t connecting with  Habitat for Humanity’s website due to an inundation of information that is unclear and unorganized. Users that visit the website in search of volunteer opportunities in particular find that the navigation flow to get to the correct information is confusing.
          </p>
          <p>The Solution: Redesign and optimize the website to create an engaging and productive experience for the users, so that they are more inclined to volunteer and reach their goals as well as helping their community.  </p>

          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p>We took a hybrid approach to our initial user research interviews by conducting a combination of task testing of the existing website as well as asking users interview questions. This helped us gain a better understanding of each user’s familiarity with the website and organization prior to the user test. This approach also helped us to learn what each user liked and disliked regarding the existing website’s usability, flow and engagement

          <p>Key Insights:
            Users aren’t connecting (emotionally) with the website
            
            Navigation menu is confusing due to verbage and an abundance of secondary navigation categories is overwhelming
            
            There’s a lot of content available on the website, it just needs to be refined and better organized
            
            It’s confusing to get to volunteer options and/or sign up page which can be frustrating/discouraging for the user

          <h2>Prioritization Matrix</h2>
              <p>Our Prioritization Matrix helped us narrow down main features we would incorporate into the redesign which we were able to include most of, such as; filtering/ selecting volunteer options based on availability, project description, clearer text, connection
              </p>
              <p>Ideas such as communicating with other users on the same platform would become a feature development item

          <h2>Card Sorting</h2>
              <p>During user testing many users found the navigation menu to be confusing due to the wording used as well as an overload of subcategories in the secondary navigation.
              </p>
              <p>Our goal was to simplify and make the main navigation more relatable, intuitive and also help form a connection with the organization by using headings such as “ Who We Are” What We Do”, etc.
